## Requirements

- Node.js v20 (see `.nvmrc`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- FFmpeg installed and in your `PATH`

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following entries:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `AENEAS_BASE_URL`
- `AENEAS_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `NOTION_TOKEN`
- `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

These variables are validated in [`src/config/env.ts`](src/config/env.ts).

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Pre-requisites

- Download and place mp4 files in `public/assets/` for background videos. These will be chosen randomly for each video composition.
- Change the `public/assets/cody.png`and `public/assets/felippe.png` images to your own profile pictures. These are used in the video compositions.

## Available scripts

Run any of the commands below with `pnpm <command>`:

- **`dev:script <topic>`** – generate a video script about the given topic
- **`dev:video`** – download the script from Notion, align audio and render the compositions
- **`dev:remotion`** – preview compositions in the browser using Remotion

## Usage overview

1. Run `pnpm dev:script "<topic>"` to generate a script draft and store it in your Notion database.
2. Execute `pnpm dev:video` to fetch the script, synthesize audio and render the video files.
3. Use `pnpm dev:remotion` to preview the compositions during development or run one of the render commands to export the final video.
