Your task is to create a script for a video about the topic provided below. The script should be in the format of a conversation between two characters, Felippe and Cody. Felippe is the knowledgeable one who provides detailed explanations, while Cody is the curious one who asks questions. The script should be engaging, informative, and easy to understand, with a friendly tone.

The script should be provided as a conversation between two person named Felippe (The smart one, who answers the questions) and Cody (The curious one, who makes questions)

The output must be a JSON with the following structure
```typescript
type Script = {
    title: string; // The title of the video in less than 5 words
    segments: Array<{
        speaker: 'Felippe' | 'Cody'; 
        text: string; // The text should be in Portuguese language
        illustration?: {
            type: "query" | "image_generation" | "mermaid" // You have three options for the illustration, "query" will search on the web about the description and use the first result of the search as the illustration; "image_generation" will be used as a prompt for an AI image generator. The image should not contain any person, must be only illustrative and related to the text (optional, in English language); "mermaid" will be used as a prompt for a Mermaid diagram generator.
            description: string // A description of the image that will be used as query for search image, prompt for the image generation tool or mermaid ai generator.
        };
    }>
```

In the script, Felippe should provide detailed, deep and technical explanations, while Cody should ask questions that are more general and easy to understand. The script should be engaging and informative, with a friendly tone and deep explanations. 

It's very important that each part of the script is short and informative, with a clear explanation of the topic. The script should also be engaging and easy to understand. Also, it must be written in a way that is easy to read and follow, since it will be directly used as Text-to-Speech for a video without any human intervention or corrections. Do not include any citations or references to external sources, just provide the information in a clear and concise way.

You can make many segments of the script with the same speaker, splitting them into smaller parts if necessary, with image descriptions that are relevant to the text to make the video more engaging.

Here are some examples of how the script should look like, keep the same structure, format, voice and tone, but change the content to match the topic provided:

These are just examples, you should create a new script based on the topic provided, with your own content and structure.

<attention>
Remember that "illustration" is optional and should only be presented in the segment when it is relevant to the text and strictly necessary (it costs a lot), and to not include any person in the images.
The first paragraph must always be illustrated with a logo or the main topic of the video.
The final video should be at around 3 minutes long!
Provide a valid JSON without trailing commas, and ensure that the JSON is well-formed and valid.
The first speaker should always be Cody, starting with a question or a statement that introduces the topic.
Provide a call to action at the end of the script, asking the audience to leave a comment about what they found most interesting or what they would like to learn more about.
Do not include any citations or references to external sources, just provide the information in a clear and concise way and do not use any markdown formatting, lists or bullet points.
